with modifications in the syntaxes (analyses methods and approaches) as well as the final report.

## Business Understanding
### Background

that, many IT-related jobs, including Data Science, are highly increasing in demand. However, 
companies tend to have their own preferable software in executing their daily tasks. Further analyses 
are then required to help DS aspirants, especially in the US, get a better chance at getting recruited 
in their desirable companies.

### Problems
Build an **effective strategy** for DS job aspirants to get a better chance on landing a DS job.

### Analytical Approaches
1. To find the **distribution of skills** needed in US states’ companies (limited to 38 states).
2. To find the **relationship** between the company state and the following aspects:
   * Skills (Python, Excel, Hadoop, Sspark, Tableau, Big Data, Deep Learning, )
   * Salary
   * Workload

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is **credential**.

## Result
### Summary
1. **Skills Distribution**: The distribution of # of skills needed in companies’ state 
varies from 0 to 7 skills. Companies in states with higher population, such as 
California, Texas, and New York tend to require their employees to master more 
skills, vice versa.
2. **Company State Correlations**: There are no significance correlations between 
company’ state with salary and workload. In contrast, there is significance 
correlation between company’ state and # of skills needed as stated above

### Recommendation
1. If you **do not** master any **high-demand skills** or aiming for **junior-level** DS jobs, then learning it right 
now are **highly prioritized**. 
(**Optional**: Try to apply at companies in Mississippi or Rhode Island, as it do not require any skills)
2. If you already master *****Python** and **Excel** or aiming for **senior-level** DS jobs, then mastering Big Data 
and/or Deep Learning is **highly recommended**.
3. Applying at companies located in **Kansas**, **Tennessee**, and **Florida** are **not recommended**, since its 
salary are low compared to its high workload (relatively).
4. Applying at companies located in **Oklahoma** and **New Jersey** are **highly recommended**, since its 
salary are high compared to its low workload (relatively)
